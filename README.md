Simple Material Calendar DatePicker offers you the date picker as shown in [the Material Design spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/pickers.html) but much simple, with an
easy API.
The library uses [the code from the Android frameworks](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/opt/datetimepicker/) as a base and tweaked it to be as close as possible to Material Design example.

Support for Android 4.0 and newer.
