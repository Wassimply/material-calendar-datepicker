Simple Android Material Calendar DatePicker
======================================================

Simple Android Material Calendar DatePicker offers you the date picker as shown in [the Material Design spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/pickers.html) but much simple, with an
easy API.
The library uses [the code from the Android frameworks](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/opt/datetimepicker/) as a base and tweaked it to be as close as possible to Material Design example.

Support for Android 4.0 and newer.

Including in Your Project
=========================

Material Calendar DatePicker is presented as an [Android library project](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html).

If you are a Gradle user you can also easily include the library:

```groovy
compile 'com.novachevskyi:material-calendar-datepicker:1.0.0'
```

If you are bringing in the support library you may need to add an exclusion:

```groovy
compile ("com.novachevskyi:material-calendar-datepicker:1.0.0") {
    exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'appcompat-v7'
}
```

Usage
=====

*For a working implementation of this project see the `sample/` folder.*

1. Define the appropriate Handler callbacks:

```java
CalendarDatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener dateSetListener =
      new CalendarDatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener() {
        @Override
        public void onDateSet(CalendarDatePickerDialog dialog, int year, int monthOfYear,
            int dayOfMonth) {
            
        }
      };
```

2. Use Builder class to create a Dialog:

```java
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
int year = calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR);
int monthOfYear = calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH);
int dayOfMonth = calendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);

final CalendarDatePickerDialog dialog =
        CalendarDatePickerDialog.newInstance(dateSetListener, year, monthOfYear, dayOfMonth);

dialog.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), "DATE_PICKER_TAG");
```
